/*
Create a database for taking notes.

What are the columns that a note table needs?
    - An autoincrement id
    - A title (of type VARCHAR(128), should be enough??)
    - A content (of type TEXT, with 65,535 characters - 64 KB should be sufficiently capable of handling typical long-form text content.)
    - Author_id is reference to an id in author table (foreign key).
    - Created_at as timestamp when a note is created.

If you have a timestamp field, how do you auto-populate it with the date?
    - DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT(GETDATE()) 
    ---> get an error "unknown function: GETDATE()"

    - created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
    ---> generate column and print date and time stamp as I wish.

A note should have a foreign key pointing to an author in an author table.

What columns are needed for the author table?
    - An autoincrement id
    - Author's first name and last name

Error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed

What happens when you try to delete an author with an existing note?
    Foreign key constraint don't allow the data that have the relationship with other tables delete or edit.

How can you prevent this?
    Add `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause to the foreign key for example 
    `FOREIGN KEY(author_id) REFERENCES author(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.

    refer to https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html 
    A "CASCADE" action propagates the delete or update operation on the parent key to each dependent child key. For an "ON DELETE CASCADE" action, this means that each row in the child table that was associated with the deleted parent row is also deleted. For an "ON UPDATE CASCADE" action, it means that the values stored in each dependent child key are modified to match the new parent key values.
